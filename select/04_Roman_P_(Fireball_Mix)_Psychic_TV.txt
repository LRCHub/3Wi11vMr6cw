Roman you are, Roman you be
Roman in your history
Roman in your victory
Roman in your destiny

[Chorus:]
Are you free, are you really free?
Are you really, really, really, really, really free?
Is it you or is it me?
Or is it simply history?
Are you free, are you really free?
Are you really, really, really, really, really free?
Is it you or is it me?
Or is it simply jealousy?

Sharon walks alone as your wife
Sharon gives her life for a knife
Sharon floating high up above
Sighing, crying, dying below

[Bridge 1:]
Oh, oh Roman, oh Roman
Roman P.

[Chorus]

Life of money, life of sex
Life of money, life of hex
Little girls drinking and eating of cake
Little girls gorge you, your greatest mistake

[Bridge 2: "Ah"s]

[Chorus]

[Bridge 1]

[Bridge 2, fade]
